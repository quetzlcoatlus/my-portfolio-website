Problem Space/Philosophy ---
I want a solid project/portfolio to show off my coding projects and maintain them over time.

I want to use the blog feature to learn through teaching; I also want to alleviate some of my fear of failing in programming and my fear of accepting where I am. 
To be a programmer, code has to become a part of my life. I have to make mistakes and I have to fail. I have to be honest with myself even though it is uncomfortable in order to do meaningful learning. 
I love computers, and I love everything about computer science, but I struggle with overthinking to the point of paralysis.

In a way, this project is my attempts at planting seeds for a more self-confident tomorrow.

Immediate Questions
- Why not just use GitHub?
GitHub for the code itself is fine, but I'd like to have organized blog/project posts as well as a dedicated website.
The point is to learn and show the development process over time in a way decentralized from GitHub as well
Hosting a website effectively accomplishes the same things GitHub does with repository hosting (which is my use case), with a lot more UX flexibility

Concept
Portfolio Website
- I want an accessible, cloud-hosted webpage anyone can look at given the URL to see my portfolio

The webpage will have 3 tabs in a navbar element:
1. A home page with an about me
  - Maybe a transparent background, linkedIn headline, most critical information
  - mission statement
2. A project showcase (portfolio) page
  - scroll bar with project timeline
3. Contact Info
relevant info like my work discord, portfolio youtube, etc.

Stretch Features:
- Be able to "highlight" different projects to show up on the front page based on what role I'm most interested in

Navigation
Depends on the design, 3 buttons on the top for now
I'd like to make this more personalized

Portfolio
My portfolio will be on a page on the website (Projects Page)

My portfolio will consist of posts displayed on a webpage
portfolio.html
post1
post2
...

I can add, edit the contents of, and delete posts on the portfolio through interacting with a database

the portfolio displays a collection of posts

a post contains
a title
description
thumbnail (optional?)
date posted
Future Planning

Webpage Host:
self hosted? another service?
